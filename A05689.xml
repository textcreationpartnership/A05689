            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17728:4"/>peruſe the grounds herein conteyned for their ſatisfaction in this point.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, conſidering no juſt cauſe of offence is given to any, for the ſubſtance of the matter eſpecially, and the neceſſity there is to witneſſe the truth, I haue publiſhed this to ſettle the judgement, and informe the conſcience of them that want better means. I know, and ſee what an hinderance it is to many in mayn points and duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to doubt in matters of ſmall moment, in ſhew and circumſtantiall; I know how many mens hearts are torn each from other, and divided about theſe things. Many go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further on the right hand in deteſtation of errours then they are called by the Lord: Doe not theſe call upon every man for the uſe of his tallent, that the hey and ſtubble built on the foundation may be removed by the approach of the light, and all may walk in one way making truth and peace to kiſſe each other.</p>
                  <p>Onely there are two things yet queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; 1 For the maner of handling theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, it ſeemes nothing fit, that ſuch plain and ſimple ſtuffe ſhould be brought to the building of the Tabernacle eſpecially there be ng ſo many men of excellent parts, furniſhed with all manner of learning and

                  <p>A ſecond doubt is, that many may be hereby b ought into danger if they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe ruſes taught, and diſſent from the common cuſtomes and received orders.</p>
                  <p>To which the anſwer is eaſy.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt himſelfe is a rock of offence, for the riſing and fall of many in Iſrael: witneſſe all ages wherein many in the viſible Church haue been offended, and ſtumbled at ſome part of his doctrine, ſacraments and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Many are not the ſheep of Chriſt but belong to another Kingdome, ne ther can they beleeue becauſe we tell the truth.

               <p n="1">1 The Magiſtrate cannot inſtitute any thing in the outward worſhip of God. None of the Kings of Iudah, without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary warrant did; but reform, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue ſuperſtition, and bring men to the true worſhip of God. 2 The Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that men ſhould not adde, which binds directly in outward worſhip. 3 The Lord hath given direction for as much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as he requires of men, and will accept, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13, <hi>Io.</hi> 2. What better colour then to haue mony-changers, and ſheep in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to further and ſpeed the ſervice of God, and diſpatch the unacquainted Iſraelites that came from far. But this, (as all humane helps not ſanctified by the Lord doe,) prophanes the houſe of God, and therfore juſtly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed thence by our Saviour Chriſt. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17728:21"/>may come neerer the Lord then hee appoints, and all that comes from man is filthy, and defiles both the Lord, and the uſer.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Circumſtances in Gods worſhip are not free, neither in theſe things may Princes command what they pleaſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Salomon</hi> hath a pattern of the Temple, and direction for the place, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.1. So for the ordering of men to theſe and theſe offices: Becauſe all things being inexpedient edifie not, <hi>Acts</hi> 1, <hi>Acts</hi> 6, 1 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Princes commanding of a thing indifferent, is no ſufficient ground for the uſage of it in the ſervice of God. For firſt, all things muſt be ſanctified by the Word, which ſhewes the right uſe of theſe things. Alſo Princes commands in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in many caſes, are not to be obeyed. As 1 if the party cannot be reſolved of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of them, then the Lord forbids to uſe them. 2 If they hurt or deſtroy: for all power is for the good of others. 3 Though they be indifferent in themſelues, yet having been monuments of Idolatry, or being now abuſed by Idolaters in ſtate of divine worſhip, <hi>Heſ.</hi> 2. 4 When they are commanded for ill ends, as to be ſignes

               <p n="4">4 Princes may not appoint ſignificant ceremonies, the ſecond commandement for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 43.8, Theſe are parts of Gods outward worſhip, for they are religious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: 2 They leſſen the eſteem of Gods own Ordinances: 3 There is no ſuch example in the whole Scripture of any holy Prince that did any ſuch thing. 4 Chriſt is the onely Teacher of his Church, therfore all doctrins and ceremonies, not appointed by him, are to be rejected; for we are bound to hear his voyce onely. 5 As theſe abound, ſo hath the Lord withdrawn his preſence from the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 43.8. 6 The Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts nothing his, but what he appoints. 7 The wil of God only makes things accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, and profitable to the Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Princes haue not power to binde the conſcience, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.21, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.12. For 1 they cannot make a thing ſimply evill. 2 They canot diſcern nor puniſh the inner man; that is onely the priviledg of the Lord. 3 Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are not ſervants of men, but onely of Chriſt, that hath purchaſed his right over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dearer then any creature is able to doe. To bind the conſcience is properly to enact ſuch
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17728:22"/>laws as binde all men ſimply, both inwardly and outwardly, at all times, and in all places to obedience, as to things good in their own nature, under pain of eternall damnation. Nevertheleſſe underſtand this without any prejudice to the Magiſtrates authority, that all men are bound for conſcience to obey Magiſtrates in their lawful commands, not for conſcience to him, but to Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and commandement, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good intended in political laws, which charity bindes unto.</p>
               <p n="6">6 No Magiſtrate can exempt from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Lord.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17728:26"/>not conceiving what order was eſtabliſhed in the Apoſtles time, and that this order now in place, keeps out the order which the Lord himſelfe hath eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Therefore, reade firſt I beſeech you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and then judge righteous judgment: we would haue Chriſt raigne over all, and each keep in that compaſſe he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, doing their ſeverall offices, without intermedling with ſtrange buſineſſes, which weaken and unfit them for the Churches ſervice. A ſecond argument of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is carnall deſire of liberty, which is the ſtrongeſt adverſary to beat down and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh. For men haue ever reſolved to break the bonds of Chriſt, and not to haue him raign over them. This makes many to rage and blaſpheme the contrary form to theſe times, becauſe they are like untamed heyfers that cannot bear the yoke of Chriſt. This ſhould rather perſwade againſt this preſent form of government, ſince men naturally are enemies to God, and cannot brook the Ordinances rightly to be adminiſtred: and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>condly that to ſuffer men to haue their own will, is a thing moſt dangerous to them, as to the Iſraelites in chooſing their King, or obtaining Quailes. Oh conſider, thou man, that art called a Chriſtian, how thy diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17728:26"/>life cauſeth the way of God to be evill ſpoken of, and ſo thou layeſt ſtumbling blocks before Papiſts and Turkes, and bringeſt fearfull woes upon thy ſelfe. This comes in part for want of ſtrict diſcipline: and therefore be content to deny thy ſelfe, and fall not upon Chriſt. And ô yee that ſit in the throne of God, make way that Chriſt this King of glory may come in, and ſet up his throne amongſt us out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
               <p>Many objections againſt this truth are brought, eſpecially the antiquity of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhops, which haue been even ſince the Apoſtles times: the ſeven Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3, they ſay were Dioceſan Biſhops, and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries mention the being and continuance of them in the Church. To this it is, and may be truely anſwered. That there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of Biſhops. 1 Apoſtolicall, which onely are pariſhionall, theſe were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, Teachers and Elders. 2 Such as were Paſtors onely, though over many Churches, ſuch were the Biſhops of the Primitiue times. 3 Dioceſan Biſhops which came in afterwards, and ſo they roſe till they came to the Popedom. That Dioceſan Biſhops were in the Apoſtles times, it wants all ſhew of reaſon, as is proved ſufficiently before. For
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17728:27"/>that out of <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3, I referre the Reader to the diſcourſe betwixt Mr. <hi>Downam,</hi> and the Anſwerer of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For <hi>Acts</hi> 20, <hi>Paul</hi> left none ſuch, but there all Elders are Biſhops. 2 All Miniſters are Angels, therfore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of Dioceſan Biſhops. 3 It is againſt all h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17728:28"/>where the Apoſtle ſhewes the office and nature of an Apoſtolicall Biſhop, which is a perſon ſet over a flock by the Holy Ghoſt, to feed that Congregation of Chriſt with others: Heere by feeding according to the uſuall manner of Scripture Diſcipline is meant too, as may be gathered from <hi>Ezech.</hi> 34, and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.

               <p>Wherfore, Brethren, yee that haue been deceived, think not ſcorn to learn from one inferiour farre in gifts, in theſe things: But hearken to the Lord, that it may goe well with you. You ſee you haue no evidence for theſe places, but preſcription and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, which though with men they may ſeem good, yet with the Lord, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: he reſpects not cuſtom, nor long continuance of time, but the right, and that which was from the beginning.

If men ſhould make but ſuch an offer that were well able to perform it, and thereto binde themſelues, would not your hearts be glad like the Levite, who having ſerved <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah,</hi> being offred a great place, to be Prieſt to the Tribe of Dan, made no queſtion?

Wheras if you doe continue, you make your ſelues guilty of the ſinnes committed in and by thoſe callings before. You ſhall fulfill the meaſure of your iniquity: you ſhall corrupt other Nations for a while, as the Pope did, and then know for a certainty, that either you ſhall be given over as doggs, as hee hath done the beaſt of Rome, or elſe the hand of the Lord will be in terrible manner againſt you.

               <p>Before I come to handle the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt them, conſider well theſe grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The name of a Church doth belong to every congregation, not properly to the clergy, as they are now called; ſo the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That ſuch callings are Antichriſtian, which ſprung up w th Ant chriſt, and ſerved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17728:52"/>Cardinalls ſhould profeſſe the Goſpell, yet their office is Antichriſtian, becauſe of the former ground, which is plain; for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is not a perſon, but a ſucceſſion of men oppoſing Chriſt in his Ordinances, and Offices, as well as otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some good uſe that a calling may haue, and ſome benefit that it brings, is no ſufficient ground to warrant it in the church of God. 1 Becauſe there is nothing, but at leaſt is well intended, and carryes a ſhew of good when it is brought into the church. 2 It may be that keeps out ſome other calling, that would bring farre more profit and benefit to the church. 3 It may be it hath ſome inſeparable evill annexed or coupled with it.</p>
               <p>Now upon theſe grounds ſufficient and weighty reaſons may be founded from the Scriptures to proue the unlawfulnes of this office, which is for one in a Dioceſs to haue authority for keeping courts, to proue wills, to right men for diſorders, and ſcandalous ſinnes, eſpecially breach of their traditions, and to cenſure men with their kinde of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and excommunication.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Diſcipline belongs to every particular congregation, without which though men may be a church (deſiring it after they are convinced of it), yet they lye open to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable dangers of their ſpirituall enemies, and cannot be ſo compacted and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a congregation and church of Chriſt ought to be.

This argument is grounded upon the ſentence and maxime of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>What God hath conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, let no man ſever.</hi> He hath joyned the miniſtry of the Word and the exerciſe of Diſcipline together, therfore no man ſhould ſever them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Theſe came in with Antichriſt, and are part of that Hierarchy.

               <p>A third Ground, in which we will be ſhorter, is that <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, <hi>hee that diſtributeth in ſimplicity,</hi> that is truſtily, without reſpect of perſons. This therefore being one of the offices (not duties) and callings, there the Apoſtle ſhews both that they ought to be in the church, and how to execute their places, that they ſhould know their callings,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17728:61"/>and be content with the ſame, ſtudying to doe ſervice in the ſame, which is the beſt meanes for unity, and to prevent the manifold diſtractions, which intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling each with others place, and office brings.</p>
               <p>A fourth ground is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, where theſe officers are called <hi>helps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The planting of them in every church, as appears, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the continuance of them long in their own nature, which is to <hi>diſtribute,</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely when the Lord fits them in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Grounds of theſe are, beſides ſuch as are mentioned before. 1 The Lord takes care both for ſoules and bodies of men, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtitutes ſuch offices peculiarly ſerving for that purpoſe. Becauſe there is no ſuch office and calling, it is impoſſible things ſhould be ſo well ordered, &amp; provided for.</p>

When thus <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua,</hi> and the ſucceeding Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges governed Iſrael, it was well with the land; Religion and proſperity going hand in hand joyntly together: Thus in <hi>Davids</hi> time, <hi>Hezakiahs</hi> time and others.

               <p>Wherfore ſince this teacheth the right way to ſtrengthen Kingdoms, and eſtabliſh Princes in their throne. Mourn thou that ſeekeſt the peace of Iſrael, that this doctrine ſhould finde ſuch ſmall acceptance, and hard entertainment, and wonder at the ſhameleſſe impudency of them, that dare avouch themſelues friends to Chriſt, and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate

                  <p>Here two Queſtions are to be anſwered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Whether this form of diſcipline inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt may be altered? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer s, it may not by any whoſoever. The grounds of it are theſe following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is a ſpeciall priviledge of Chriſts Kingly Office to govern his Church out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by diſcipline, as well as by the Word, Chr ſt hath this Scepter and Rod, and none <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ſhew his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what ſhould be altered before it come to paſſe, that changes diſturbe not their minds. This is plain; for thus be did before hee placed his name in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> before Chriſt came, before the Gentiles were to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Wherfore if the Lord would haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered this, he would haue told it his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, elſe Chriſt ſhould not be ſo faithfull a Prophet as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſhewed that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was to endure till Chriſt ſhould come: elſe Chriſt ſhould not ſhew all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his Church.</p>

The Lord joyneth a renewing of his covenant, with the inſtitution of all things any way needfull for his Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 To deſire a new form of government is <hi>to caſt off the Lord from raigning over us,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7, which place binds in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call as firmly as in Civill.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe the Lord inſtituted this, as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17728:71"/>well as that: 2 there was no expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that the people ſhould ever be tyed to this form of government, but that it was rather appointed that they ſhould haue a King, &amp; his duty deſcribed: 3 the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it becauſe they would be like the world in ſtate and pomp: 4 they did not firſt know the Lords pleaſure, but headily followed their affections.

                  <p>Like to this is that <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8.22, where <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> being offered the Kingdom, refuſed it for this cauſe, that the Lord might raign over them; which plainly ſhews what wrong they doe to the Lord, &amp; his people, which bring in another government then the Lords?

               <p n="5">5 The church hath no authority to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a new Diſcipline, this is plainly proved in an other place.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The church hath no authority to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ceremonies or rites. 1 Which are not decent, and fitting the nature and quality of that preſent ordinance of God. 2 Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as firſt, that each thing be done in his due place; publique things, publiquely; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate things privately: ſecondly, things more

               <p>IT is the duty of all the ſervants of God, to keep themſelues unſpotted of the world, eſpecially in the ſervice of God, which Satan chiefly ſeek to corrupt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the image and face of God.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Arguments to proue their unlawfulneſſe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 In the time of the old Teſtament, Prieſts and Levits were to teach the people, to diſcern betwixt the clean and unclean, &amp;c. therfore in the time of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherin there is more abundance of ſpirit promiſed, and more plentifull decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods will, the Miniſters ought to be able to teach Gods people twixt good and evill.</p>
                  <p>This argument holds firm, ſince the Lord hath as great care of his Church now
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17728:76"/>as then; and is as carefull to haue them avoide ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Where viſion faileth the people periſh, Prov.</hi> 29.18, theſe men are no Seers, nor haue any viſion but darkneſſe and night.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They are <hi>dumb doggs, Iſa. 56, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not barke, blinde watchmen, ſhepheards that cannot underſtand.</hi> What a liuely deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a reading Miniſter here is? He cannot underſtand what paſture is good or fitting for the people; he is a blind Watchman that can foreſee no danger, nor plague comming, when they doe hear Wolues are towards and amidſt the flock; yet they haue no mouthes to bark and fright them away. Let no man be ſo bold as to cavill at the Scriptures which are ſo plain, that he which runnes may reade them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 They cannot <hi>divide the Word rightly,</hi> which is the chiefe work of the Miniſter of the Word, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15, which who ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe at all, is none of Gods workmen: they who cannot, nor will ſtudy to doe well, and righteouſly, are none of the Lords ſervants.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 They cannot defend the truth, nor ſtop the mouths of gain-ſayers, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miniſter ought to doe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. Elſe how ſhall errours and hereſies be prevented? and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17728:77"/>to runne to others in this caſe, will yeeld ſmall releefe; conſidering the unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the moſt to be taught, or take any paines at leaſt to ſeek inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The Lord thruſts out Labourers, not Loyterers into the Harveſt, ſuch men as doe ſome execellent work for the good of his Church, <hi>Math.</hi> 9, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. Theſe men are idle, their work is not ſo excellent, nor is it ſpeciall, and proper.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The Shepheard that hath nothing more then the Sheep haue, cannot poſſibly keep the ſheep well, for then ſheep might keep themſelues, and the calling of God is unprofitable. Theſe haue not ſo much as many ſheep.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 They are not fit to meddle with the ſoule, to ſeek it in time; being diſtempred, they cannot ſhew man Gods righteouſneſſe, neither pray for him; they cannot ſeek that which is loſt, nor bring back that which is driven away; nor heale the ſick. Now Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are chiefly ſent thus to benefit the ſoule. And if they cannot help in time of diſtreſſe, they are miſerable comforters, like <hi>Iobs</hi> friends.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17728:77"/>and applying of the word of God, to build up the people of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving errour, rebuking ſin, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon ſound doctrine.

                  <p n="11">11 The word thus barely read, hath not the power and majeſty that is mentioned in Scripture, neither that efficacy and power in converting ſoules: which argues it is not the arm of God.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Miniſters are the Lords Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and Stewards: theſe men cannot ſpeak nor ſue to the ſoules for Chriſt, to beſeech men to receiu him: neither can they be faithfull unto their Lord. They are the ſhame and diſhonour of Chriſtian Churches, as though the Spirit of God were not purchaſed by Chriſt for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of men for his Church. It is in effect to deny Chriſts victory over the enemy of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:17728:78"/>our ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1.2.3.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 <hi>He that winneth ſoules is wiſe;</hi> theſe are not wiſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe none will vouchſafe to Reply for theſe, that haue any ſpark of piety to God, or pitty towards his people. Onely ſome Non-reſidents, that keep poore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings; or greedy Patrones; or Popiſh Atheiſts, that would haue the light of the Goſpell die; or poore ignorant people that never knew what the Goſpell meant; or men that would liue at their own wils in all licentiouſneſſe; theſe happily would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the plea againſt Chriſt. But it were better their tongue ſhould cleau to the roof of their mouth, then they ſhould once dare goe about the overthrow of Chriſts Miniſtry. Heare therfore and conſider, that it may goe well with you.</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewed the inſufficiency, now follows the nullity of theſe men; which the rather I inſiſt upon, becauſe many would be content, if they were inſufficient, being Miniſters (carnall men, never ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding how the Lord is ſerved:) But being no Miniſters in Gods acceptance, I hope it will work upon them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Therfore <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6, God pronounceth them none to him: (that is in his acceptance)

Or who are you, ô yee peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ye are contented with ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to the Lord for you, whoſe prayers are not accepted by the Lord for you! This Argument is firm and cannot be gainſaid; For if the authority of man be enough to diſplace whom God hath ſent, ſhall not the Lords authority much more diſplace whom man onely hath ſent?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 He which wants either the nature, or eſſentiall property of a Miniſter, is not a true Miniſter; for the nature and property of things cannot be ſevered from the things themſelues. But reading Miniſters want ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nature, or at leaſt the eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a Miniſter: This appears, becauſe the Miniſter is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7, and his <hi>lipps ſhould preſerue knowledge.</hi> To teach the people is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall property and difference twixt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and people. Whence it alſo appears that there is no difference amongſt Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for the ſubſtance of their Calling. For each one is the Meſſenger of the Lord of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17728:79"/>Hoſts. 2 He which is not a Meſſenger is no Miniſter, for that is common to all. 3 He whoſe lippes doe not preſeru know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is no Meſſenger. Who ſees not that the Reading Miniſter differs in the ſubſtance of his Calling? 2 That he hath no Meſſage. 3 That his lippes doe not preſeru know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but looſe it rather. How dare yee counterfeit therfore the Lords place any of you whom the Lord hath not ſent?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Chriſt hath not gifted nor appointed for the good of his Church, Reading Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, therfore they are none of his. For he is the King of his Church, and men can no more bring in Readers then Friers amongſt the people of God. 2 Miniſters run becauſe they are ſent by him. 3 Chriſt will bleſſe none but ſuch as he ſends. That read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters are not gifted, nor appointed, it is plain from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, where all are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up that are allowed by Chriſt: which place is left as a rule of trying Miniſters. Try them by their office, and uſe of the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19.20, Miniſters muſt goe and teach making others Chriſts Diſciples, and teach them to obſeru what he hath commanded. Reading Miniſters hence are none: for he that hath no authority from
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17728:79"/>Chriſt, hath none; for he hath all authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in earth as well as in heaven: Reading Miniſters are not ſent by Chriſt. 2 They cannot ſo teach as others may be made the diſciples of Chriſt. 3 They cannot teach the converted to keep the Ordinances of Chriſt unto the end of the world, which is added, leſt any ſhould think, that either men converted, and Churches planted ſhould not need the Miniſtery of the Word, or that in ſome times of ſcarcity, men may put in Readers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Math.</hi> 24. He that is not faithfull, nor wiſe, is not ſet over the family of the Lord, to giue them their portion in due ſeaſon: But Reading Miniſters are not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nor wiſe, neither know mens portions, neither the portion of one nor another; for they cannot diſcern twixt a civill man, and the child of God; neither know the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the weak nor of the ſtrong; neither can they giue each one their portion in due ſeaſon. This is plain by Experience.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Whom the Holy Ghoſt hath not ſet over the people he is none: but theſe are not ſet over by the Holy Ghoſt; for there is no rule nor example to warrant them. This Argument is grounded on <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28, where the Holy Ghoſt is the Author of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17728:80"/>Miniſtery. 2 The perſons are Elders, that are and ought to take heed to themſelues and others. 3 Are to feed and govern the Church of Chriſt; which doth not agree to the order of Reading Miniſters.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 He who is a Biſhop of God, muſt be apt to teach; but theſe are not; for they haue no Miniſteriall gift, nor haue they the form of wholeſom doctrine. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is grounded upon <hi>Pauls</hi> Canons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.</p>
                  <p>His wrok, who is a Miniſter, is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, that <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> But reading miniſters haue no ſuch work of excellency, but any yong Scholler may be ſufficient for this work.</p>
                  <p>Every true Miniſter is ſucceſſor to the Apoſtles in the ſubſtance of their Calling, which is teaching the whole counſell of God to that Congregation they are ſet over by the Holy Ghoſt: But theſe Readers are ſucceſſors to dumb Dogs, and blind guides. All divine relation is grounded either on the nature of the thing, or ſome divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which indeed is the proper ground. To be a Miniſter is a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and hath no ſuch ground in theſe men.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The argument is not firm, from the name to the thing: For, the divill rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up by the witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> is called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel:</hi> 2 they are ſo called, that it may be known to whom the Holy Ghoſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
                  <p>From hence it is plain how unlawfull a thing it is to joyn with Reading miniſters, in any miniſteriall duty, either praying, or adminiſtring the Sacraments; For,</p>

               <p>THough it may ſeem loſt labour to goe over this ſubject, which is ſo largely and learnedly handled by men of excellent gifts; yet ſince the ceremonies remain, and are more ſtraitly urged then before. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fitting we ſhould never reſt till theſe bleyns of our Church be removed: we muſt contend for the faith, and leaue many teſtimonies to poſterity, of the diſlike of theſe human inventions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therfore to propound ſome generall grounds touching the nature and uſe of theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It muſt be remembred that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion book contains in the judgment of our adverſaries, a briefe and ſumme of Gods outward worſhip. This is plain ſince them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues call it divine Service. 2 They require more reverence to this, then to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God: 3 They command this chiefly, and puniſh men moſt for abſence from this: 4 They giue charge none of this ſhould bee omitted for preaching: 5 They appoint ſuch Miniſters as can doe nothing elſe but read this: 6 They binde men to this, though they haue no preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17728:103"/>in the Congregation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Theſe now controverted Ceremonies are impoſed to ſtir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty; in their Preface to the Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They are ſo impoſed, as men muſt be in bondage to them and uſe them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of any mans weakneſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Men deem them fitting not onely for theſe times, and this preſent Church, but fitting every place: for they deſire and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring all ſtrangers to the ſame Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
               <p n="5">5 In experience, theſe Ceremonies are utterly unprofitable, and doe not further the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Theſe ceremonies haue been too long in the Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7 They were brought in, in times of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when many corruptions had gotten in. The Surplus and Kneeling can not bee proved to haue been before the height of Popery.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Theſe Ceremonies haue been all groſly abuſed to Idolatry, and will-worſhip by the Papiſts, from whoſe hands we receiu them.</p>

               <p n="12">12 They ſo count of theſe, that they had rather looſe 300 godly able Preachers, then not haue theſe Ceremonies uſed every where.</p>
               <p>The firſt argument againſt Ceremonies, is out of <hi>Ex.</hi> 20.24.25, where note theſe two Concluſions. 1 That the Lord loues not outward pompe, nor mans inventions in his ſervice: for the Lord will haue the altar of earth; or if it be of ſtone, it muſt not be of hewen ſtone. 2 That mans polliſhing, and adorning any thing, without ſpeciall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, defiles the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:17728:104"/>
               <p> Theſe arguments are firm againſt our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: 1 Becauſe they are but outward pompe, and mans inventions, as themſelues grant: 2 Outward adorning of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with this <hi>ſurplus</hi>-garment pollutes him, ſince they haue no warrant for the ſame.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This place proues that men muſt not doe as idolatrous heathens doe. Whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeru.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That which is an ordinance of the heathens ought to be abhorred, being not grounded on the Word, or light of nature: To worſhip God outwardly after their own manner, with any thing whatſoever men deviſe is the manner of heathen, and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This place and the like made the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies unlawfull at the very firſt bringing in of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That we muſt not walk in their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: but to uſe the <hi>Croſſe</hi> and <hi>Surplus</hi> are the ordinances of the Papiſts now: they ſtraightly injoyn them; they can and doe lay beſt claim unto them: other Reformed Churches haue rejected them.</p>
               <p>If any man ſay this place is meant of their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17728:104"/>abomination in uncleanneſſe, defiling themſelues after their manner.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is plain, the place is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, including all their manners and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, as may be gathered out of the text. Ordinances ſignifie for the moſt part, if not ever, the Ceremonies. 2 Becauſe the Lord binds them onely to his Statuts and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, <hi>v.</hi> 4. 3 The Lord abhorrs as much or more, the inventions of men, and the manner of the heathens in his ſervice, as outward uncleannes. Therfore <hi>argumentum à pari neceſſario concludit.</hi>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The Lord will haue his children unlike Idolaters outwardly, and eſpecially the Miniſters of his Word. This propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is grounded on <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.27.28, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.5. Whence it is plain, that to injoyn miniſters conformity with idolaters, is unlawfull for him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and him that obeys. For the Lord forbids it by this reaſon, which none can ſatisfie; for he offereth the bread of the Lord. Whence learn, that he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes publique worſhip to God, muſt not be like Idolaters. Miniſters now perform publique worſhip to the Lord. Neither let any ſay, that the <hi>Croſſe, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, and Kneeling</hi> are trifles: for ſo men

               <p>Which things are plain againſt our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.

               <p>HAving ſhewed the unlawfulneſſe of theſe Ceremonies; in the next place we are to perſwade for the removall of them: Therfore the ſecond Commandee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be fully known and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and ſo the Lord ſhall haue great
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17728:126"/>glory. Now the ſubſtance of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is to bar the dore againſt all falſe worſhip, and human inventions, wherin the Lord forbids man to make to himſelfe of his own head, all religious Ceremonies: This commandement being (as all others are) a common head to which all, the very leaſt things in that kind are to be referred: And the Lords backing this with ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible reaſons, ſhould moue all honeſt and good hearts. It is the Lord that forbids, who dare countermand or bid the contrary. 1 It is thy God by covenant that thou haſt given thy name unto. 2 It is thine husband, if authority will not perſwade, yet let loue rule thee. 3 The Lord is a jealous God, and cannot indure any part of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be given to mans deviſes, that they ſhould be counted his Name, the Lord ſees this to bee the beginning of declining. 4 The Lord viſites the ſinnes of parents, that haue inſtituted and followed theſe devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of man in his worſhip, upon the children that ſo reverence their forefathers, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that they will tread in their ſteps, and retain the ſame Ceremonies. 5 All this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing of Ceremonies, and appointing of them is hatred againſt the Lord. 6 Pure worſhip of God argues men doe truely loue
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:17728:126"/>him, and haue care to keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 7 This brings bleſſings upon us, and many generations, even thouſands that worſhip the Lord according to his will.</p>
               <p>Hearken, ô yee men, brethren, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, unto the Lord our God, and ceaſe to provoke him to wrath; it is too long wee haue lived in the breach of this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, troubling them that haue deſire to walk ſincerely with the Lord.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Ground is, becauſe then Chriſt ſhall be known to be the onely King of his Church, and men ſhall not dare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound any thing as doctrine, nor urge the ſervants of God to any practiſe, but what the word commands. Now under the name of the Church and Chriſtian Magiſtrate: How is the Kingdom of Chriſt weakened by ſome? Then ſhall that <hi>Ezech.</hi> 34.24, bee fulfilled. <hi>I will be their God, and my ſervant David ſhall be Prince amongſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third ground is the beauty of Gods face, and the glory of the Goſpell ſhould more appear, and ſhine forth, which now is clouded heerby many waies. For 1, men wreſt the Scriptures for the defence of theſe: 2 the whole counſell of God cannot be freely preached: 3 that divine order in each Congregation is diſſolved, which ſhould
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17728:127"/>ſhew who are ſheep and who are goats: 4 the Lord is brought in favouring the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and making ſad the hearts of his own ſervants; for men of tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are accuſed and traduced as turbulent ſpirits: Men ſhould then bend themſelues to teach the main grounds of Religion, which now are unknown: and how dear ſhould this be to us Engliſhmen eſpecially, by whoſe means our land hath been ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured, and wonderfully lifted up aboue others.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Chriſtian meetings and holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints (the nouriſher of grace) wherin men might be benefitting and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, ſhould be ſuffred: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as men now meeting for holy ends, are troubled, as making Conventicles dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the State. What were it for our Magiſtrates to haue the prayers of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good hearts, for their ſafety? Then ſhould that be fulfilled, <hi>Zachar.</hi> 8.20.21, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The Goſpell ſhould be freely preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there would then be nothing to hinder either admittance or continuance, in the Miniſtery. This liberty of the Goſpell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures continuance of our liberty; and tho reſtrayning of this makes the Lord depart,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17728:127"/>and brings bondage, captivity, and the ſword upon the Nation. Then ſhould the people that ſit in ignorance and the ſhadow of death, ſee a great light, &amp; ſo many ſhould not periſh for want of viſion.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Magiſtrates ſhould be out of danger of thoſe threats, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5, for paſſing their bounds, and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29, none ſhould make Iſrael ſin and wound their conſciences with theſe leſſer things at firſt, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fall into extremity and height of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Miniſters ſhould haue more gifts and more authority: for the ſetting up theſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the ſpirit of God; and ſuch urging of theſe, without ground from the Word makes that their miniſtery grow farre leſſe reſpected.

               <p>The people that are in bondage ſo as they may not examine things, but receiu

               <p n="1">1 That theſe Ceremonies in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie are impoſed upon the people, as well as Miniſter, as may appear in the Preface to the Ceremonies in the Service book, and that in the name of the people, the Miniſter pronounceth, <hi>We receiue this child,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Our Saviour Chriſt caſt out all thoſe mony-changers that had ſeated themſelues in the houſe of the Lord before hee taught in the Temple, and <hi>Ioſiah</hi> cleanſed the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before he offred in it: This therefore ſhews men ſhould not offer their ſacrifices where there are abominations and filthines.</p>

               <p>Though men may cavill at the former places, as being meant of the innner man, yet the latter are plaine. This toucheth men in that it is impoſed upon all.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Men doe not flee from it, but draw neer unto it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The worſhip there performed is not pure but mixt, for men are commanded to break the ſecond commandement.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Though the perſonall ſins of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter doe not hurt the people, yet his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall and publique ſins doe hurt, which he performs from the people to God.</p>

               <p> Having treated of the true diſcipline, and corrupt Ceremonies: Now in the next place we may ſee whether Miniſters be juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their Miniſtry. Him that doubts and will conſider wiſely, I doubt not but theſe grounds will ſatisfie.</p>
               <p n="1">1 No Scripture binds to the obedience of ſuch things: Why ſhould men be more wiſe then the Lord, or more holy, or put men out of Gods ſervice for things hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not at their hands?
